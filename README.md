<h1>LeetCode problems in pure C!</h1>

Working through NeetCode's roadmap for LeetCode.

<h3>Data Structure Implementations</h3>
- Linked Lists (Singly & Doubly)
- Stacks & Queues
- Hashmaps & Hash Sets
- Trees (Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Trie)
- Graphs & Heaps

<h3>Algorithmic Solutions</h3>
- Sorting & Searching
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Traversal (DFS, BFS)
- Bit Manipulation

<h3>Why C?</h3>
- Speed and performance
- Forces understanding of data structures with limited standard library features
